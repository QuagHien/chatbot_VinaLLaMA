## Fine-tuned VinaLLaMA
To create a Vietnamese language chatbot capable of engaging in daily conversations, we will fine-tune the VinaLLaMA model using the conversation dataset 'alespalla/chatbot_instruction_prompts'.
## Customizing Code
Initializing the model: "vilm/vinallama-7b-chat" - a model trained by a Vietnamese research group on a predominantly Vietnamese dataset.

Our goal is to build a chatbot that can conduct daily conversations. To improve answer quality, we will fine-tune VinaLLaMA on the conversation dataset named 'alespalla/chatbot_instruction_prompts'.
